Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000 
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table =10,000
	


2. Find the total number of distinct records for the primary keys in each of the tables listed below:

i. Business = 10,000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 7,854
vi. Checkin = none 
vii. Photo = 4,659
viii. Tip = none
ix. User = 2,576
x. Friend = none  
xi. Elite_years = none

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: NO
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT
 count(*)
	
FROM
 user

	WHERE
 id IS NULL
	
	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: 0		max: 2,000	avg: 24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT b.City, count(b.Id)
	FROM business b
	GROUP BY b.City
	ORDER BY count(b.Id) DESC
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results: 

Including number of fans in data set indicates that there is no correlation between review count and number of fans.  For example, top 5 results:
+-----------+------------------------+--------------+------+
| name      | id                     | review_count | fans |
+-----------+------------------------+--------------+------+
| Gerald    | -G7Zkl1wIWBBmD0KRy_sCw |         2000 |  253 |

09. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: More reviews with love
		Hate 232
		Love 1,780
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
  
	(SELECT *
  
	FROM review 
	WHERE text like '%hate%');

	
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
  
	(SELECT *
  
	FROM review 
	WHERE text like '%love%');

	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT u.name, u.id, u.fans
	FROM user u
	GROUP BY u.fans
	ORDER BY u.fans DESC
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

11. Is there a strong relationship (or correlation) between having a high number of fans and being listed as "useful" or "funny?" Out of the top 10 users with the highest number of fans, what percent are also listed as “useful” or “funny”?

Key:
0% - 25% - Low relationship
26% - 75% - Medium relationship
76% - 100% - Strong relationship
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT u.name, u.id, u.fans, u.useful, u.funny
	FROM user u
	GROUP BY u.fans

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results: 
It looks like there is no correlation between fan number and whether a user was labeled as funny or useful as those with the most fans have a variety of useful/funny label numbers.  
		

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

No, distribution of hours not a factor

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Yes, review count included in analysis          
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Location data inconclusive as related to how a business is rated 

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT *
FROM business 
WHERE CITY like '%Vegas%'

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
Type of business (based on name)          
         
ii. Difference 2:
Location (based on city)        
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT name, city, stars, review_count, is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
ORDER BY stars DESC
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Looking at what makes a top-rated business         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I choose to join businesses data with categories to see if how a company was classified influenced ratings.  I also looked at location and number of reviews.  Whether a business was still open or not was also a factor.                            
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
